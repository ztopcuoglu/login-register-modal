## What is inside?

The tech stacks that is used to build and deploy this boilerplate code include Next.js, TailwindCSS, Zustand, and Vercel. 
- Next.js, a powerful React-based framework, for its server-side rendering capabilities and ability to create dynamic pages. 
- TailwindCSS was used to design our website's user interface, providing us with a sleek and modern design. 
- Zustand was used to build our state management system, making it easier to maintain user preferences, such as their preferred theme.
- Finally, the code is deployed on Vercel, a platform that offers advanced deployment and management features, allowing us to scale and maintain website more efficiently to have a demo website.
